Here's a structured and professional documentation for your IT support chatbot code. It's written in Markdown format, which is common for project documentation in repositories, but I can also generate it in another format if preferred.

# IT Support Chatbot Documentation

## Overview

This IT Support Chatbot is designed to answer frequently asked questions (FAQs) for an IT consulting firm. It utilizes Python's `difflib` library to match user queries to stored questions, providing relevant responses to enhance user experience. The chatbot interface allows users to select questions by number, search by keyword, or exit the chat gracefully.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.6+** is required.
- **Flask** (optional): Install if you intend to deploy the chatbot as a web application.
- Run the following command to install Flask (if needed):
  ```bash
  pip install Flask
  ```

## Code Walkthrough

### 1. **Importing Required Libraries**

```python
import difflib  # Import difflib for fuzzy matching
```

The `difflib` library is used to identify close matches between user queries and FAQ questions, allowing the chatbot to understand variations in user input.

### 2. **FAQ Data Structure**

The FAQs are stored in a dictionary format, with each question assigned a unique key. Each FAQ has a `question` and an `answer`.

```python
faqs = {
    "1": {
        "question": "What services does your IT consulting firm offer?",
        "answer": "We offer Database Management, Cloud Computing, Network Security, Web Development, and Technical Support."
    },
    # Additional FAQs...
}
```

### 3. **Functions**

#### `display_faqs()`

Displays a list of available FAQs to the user with numbered options.

```python
def display_faqs():
    print("\nHere are our most frequently asked questions:")
    for key, faq in faqs.items():
        print(f"{key}. {faq['question']}")
    print("0. Exit")
```

#### `search_faqs(query)`

Allows users to search FAQs by entering keywords or phrases. The `difflib.get_close_matches` method is used to find relevant questions based on the user’s input.

```python
def search_faqs(query):
    questions = [faq['question'] for faq in faqs.values()]
    close_matches = difflib.get_close_matches(query, questions, n=5, cutoff=0.3)
    if close_matches:
        print("\nHere are the questions that closely match your search:")
        for match in close_matches:
            for key, faq in faqs.items():
                if faq['question'] == match:
                    print(f"{key}. {faq['question']}")
    else:
        print(f"\nNo FAQs found matching '{query}'. Please try another keyword.")
```

#### `chatbot()`

Provides a text-based interface to interact with the user. Users can select an FAQ by entering its number, search using a keyword, or exit.

```python
def chatbot():
    print("Welcome to IT Consulting Firm Support! How can I assist you today?\n")

    while True:
        display_faqs()
        user_input = input("Enter the number of your question, a keyword to search, or '0' to exit: ").strip()

        if user_input == "0":
            print("Thank you for contacting IT Consulting Firm! Have a great day!")
            break
        elif user_input.isdigit() and user_input in faqs:
            print(f"\nAnswer: {faqs[user_input]['answer']}\n")
        else:
            search_faqs(user_input)
```

### 4. **Main Program Execution**

The chatbot function is executed if the script is run directly.

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chatbot()
```

## Usage Instructions

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Run the script in a Python environment.
   - The chatbot will greet the user and prompt for input.

2. **Interacting with the Chatbot**:
   - Type the number of an FAQ to get an answer.
   - Type a keyword or phrase to search for related FAQs.
   - Enter `0` to exit the chatbot.

## Future Enhancements

- **Web Interface**: Integrate Flask to create a web-based version.
- **Natural Language Processing**: Use NLP libraries like NLTK or spaCy for improved question matching.
- **Database Integration**: Store FAQs in a database for easier updates and scalability.
